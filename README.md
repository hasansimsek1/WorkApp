# WorkApp
Simple productivity app that I would like to use on my daily life. It has kanban board, todo and note taking features for now. Also I am planning to publish this app on the web free of charge.


It is not ready to use but I will be working on it.

### If you want to get it running, take these steps..
* Get the solution from github (clone or download)
* Change conntection strings in appsettings.json files in the AspNetCoreMvc and Wpf projects. Note that this application uses Sql Server as its database.
* In the Package Manager Console set the Default Project to DataAcess and execute Update-Database command.
* Build and run..
